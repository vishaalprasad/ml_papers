Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

This is an implementation of VAEs, as described in Kingma and Welling (2013).

VAEs are generative models that lie in the intersection of Variational Bayesian methods and neural networks (i.e. autoencoders). As my background is with autoencoders, I will use them as a framework to explain this concept.
